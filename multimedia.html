      <h3> Learn German Prepositions</h3>
<p>  AQA, OCR and Edexcel GCSE exam boards require GCSE students like you, to have basic knowledge of the German prepositions (Pr채positionen in German). Students who take the higher tier exam will almost definetely be required to use prepostions in the exam.  </p>
 <hr>
      
    
  <h3> Reminder! What is a preposition?</h3> 
      <p> Read the sentence below and listen to this short clip to find out what a preposotion is:<p/>
     <p> Prepositions are words which indicate location. They are used before a noun, a noun phrase, or a pronoun, connecting it to another word. For example, in the sentence 'The cat jumped over the garden fence', 'over' is the preposition. </p>

  <p> Task: There are some short excercises included at the end of the video, think about the answers and then use the knowledge you have 
   learnt to complete the sentences in the comprehension exercise below:</p>
      <p> Tip! Play close attention to the table included within the video that starts at 3:51. This will be helpful for the comprehension exercise below.

      <h3> Comprehnsion Exercise </h3>
      <iframe src="https://h5p.org/h5p/embed/36386" width="1090" height="778" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><script src="https://h5p.org/sites/all/modules/h5p/library/js/h5p-resizer.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
        <p> Don't worry if you found the above exercise difficult! This is a task that is mainly for higher tier students. Even some advanced learners struggle with this. </p>
        <p>From this exercise you should have learnt:<p/> 
      <p>
      Use accusative if there is a change of location or position and if the action has moved from one place to a different place.

You should use dative if the former does not occur, such as if the action is happening in a confined space.</p>
