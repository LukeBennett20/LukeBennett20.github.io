      <h3> Learn German Prepositions</h3>
<p>  AQA, OCR and Edexcel GCSE exam boards require GCSE students like you, to have basic knowledge of the German prepositions (Präpositionen in German). Students who take the higher tier exam will almost definetely be required to use prepostions in the exam.  </p>
 <hr>
      
    
  <h3> Reminder! What is a preposotion?</h3> 
      <p> Listen to this short clip to find out what a preposotion is:<p/>

      <h3> Wechselpräpositionen!</h3> 
      <p>These so-called "changing prepositions" either take the accusative or dative case in German. Watch the video below to find out more!</p>

  <p> Task: There are some short excercises included at the end of the video, think about the answers and then use the knowledge you have 
   learnt to complete the sentences in the comprehension exercise below:</p>
      
      <p> The Wechselpräpositionen are: an, auf, hinter, neben, über, vor, zwischen, in and unter <p/>

      <h3> Comprehnsion Exercise </h3>
      <iframe src="https://h5p.org/h5p/embed/36386" width="1090" height="778" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><script src="https://h5p.org/sites/all/modules/h5p/library/js/h5p-resizer.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
        <p> Don't worry if you found the above exercise difficult! This is a task that is mainly for higher tier students. Even some advanced learners struggle with this </p>
        <p>From this exercise you should have learnt:<p/> 
      <p>
      Use accusative if there is a significant change of location/position. In other words, if the action has moved from one place to a different place, or a specific "border" has been crossed.

You should use dative if the former does not occur, i.e. if the action is occurring in a confined, defined space.</p>
