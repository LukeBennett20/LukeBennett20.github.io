      <p> <b> Did You Know...</b>  To improve recycling rates, Germany intoduced a system named <i> Pfandflasche </i> ('Bottle deposits' in English). Pfand is portion of the price on a bottle of drink that you get back if you return the bottle to the retail chain you bought it from. This can be up to 0.25 euros per bottle! So, don't throw your plastic and alluminium bottles away when you got to Germany!</p>
